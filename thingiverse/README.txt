# Summary

Modified the symmetrical Festool FS track stop block from Enrico74 for use on Triton TTS1400 tracks.

There's an anti-flip ledge on the Triton tracks that the Festool lacks.  This modified STL accounts for that ledge and also shortens the riding depth.  Nut and knobs are from the original design and can be downloaded from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:921136.

# Print Settings

Printer: MP Select Mini
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: .22mm
Infill: 25%

Notes: 
PLA is fine.  Didn't use nuclear green.  Orange is best.  ;)

# How I Designed This

Brought the original into Meshmixer and plane cut down to size.  Recombine and export.  Several tries until I could get a nice test-hold.

Let me know if it needs tweaking - I ran out of the M6 bolt & nuts and just used a printed one for size fitting.
